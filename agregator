mmd-ship1-dev
amgmusic - main database of all records that we've collected (MySQL, CloudSQL - postgres)




once per day for on-prem system - 4 hours to agregate exports for the end clients

reasons to migrate to GCP
- security
- hard to maintanence
- no one know a project fully
- windows servers 2008 cost like 50 000 usd

why do we need Report Data and Federated Query? why dont use just Cloud SQL?
- 4 hours for generating export data on-prem, MySQL vs 20 minutes generating export from big query + 2 hours from cloud sql to report data

- CloudSQL to Report Data (Federated query) - 2.5 hours, ~100Gb, and goal is to do it with 100Mb, and faster




Write to Joe
- what is AMG Music and how does it applies to entry aggregator?
- what for the CloudSQL db is used for? Why do we put all data here after aggregation?


MAK QUESTIONS:
- is the data in mmd-muz-main-dev is the result of aggregation?
- Rovi Editorial aka Vesta is a tool used to troubleshoot all Music products (AMG  Music, Muze Music, Rovi Music)
AMG music, Muze music? are this a vendors like Sony or AEC?

additional:
- The idea is to serialize the model to avro format and load it to bigquery landing dataset.
-- is landing dataset is something that is going to be created later on?
-- what the content of landing dataset should looks like?



agregator

MMD Dev
MMD Staging

read data from big query (data lake -> landing data) - its good to have a big query as a storage of non agregated data, but it's bad for the client because its cheap but slow for the read write operations

MySQL is syncronized with the CloudSQL

we store data for CloudSQL in csv-like file with the U+0001 and U+0002 separators

identify duplicates, produce one record with most valuable info about record

put to cloud sql as a result
